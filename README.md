# BSON Decoder
A very simple BSON decoder. It can only do a few of the element types, and it doesn't print them out very well. Oh, and it assumes that a file has exactly one document in it, which I honestly don't know if that's a good assumption.

But! It does work. I kind of love decoding like this, so I decided to take this problem on.

See [the official spec](https://bsonspec.org/spec.html) for more details.
